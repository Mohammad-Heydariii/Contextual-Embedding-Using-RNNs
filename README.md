# Contextual-Embedding-Using-RNNs
Contextual embeddings assign each word a representation based on its context, thereby capturing uses of words across varied contexts and encoding knowledge that transfers across languages.
in this repository we tend to implement this concept using Recurrent Neural Networks.
